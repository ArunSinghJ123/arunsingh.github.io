My tech journey started with a headset and a phone—troubleshooting networking devices while mastering the art of staying patient with, “Do you see the green light on the router?” Fast forward 15 years, and I have gone from solving SOHO networking issues to tackling large scale cloud and AI challenges for enterprises.

In my current role as a Senior Solutions Architect for AWS Enterprise customers, I help organizations accelerate their Cloud and AI adoption, optimizing cloud investments for efficiency and ROI. My work requires engaging with both tech and business leaders, translating technical complexity into business strategy (and vice versa) through business reviews, executive briefings, technical sessions, and strategic planning. Understanding businesses horizontally and delivering vertically is key, so I collaborate across AWS sales, go-to-market, partner, product, and support teams—because the best solutions are built through collaboration.

Beyond customer engagements, I am passionate about thought leadership and mentoring the next generation of talent, sharing insights and experiences to help others navigate the ever-evolving world of technology.
